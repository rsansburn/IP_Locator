The reason its not working for some is 
because the folder has to be placed in a location 
where you can modify a directory through cmd prompt

for some people when you try to do mkdir sei the folder is not created

My solution
Find WSDL url online
Next go to your JDK directory(C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_21)
Copy the jdk1.7.0_21 folder
Paste the folder on your desktop

Go back to command prompt
Go path you just created on your desktop

which may look something like this
Ex. C:\Users\Computer Science\Desktop\jdk1.7.0_21

your cmd prompt should look something like this now
C:\Users\Computer Science\Desktop\jdk1.7.0_21>

Now add the wsimport
wsimport http://www.webservicex.net/geoipservice.asmx?WSDL

then look for the net file in the directory
