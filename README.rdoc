IP Locator Interactive Proj

What was used to develop the application:
  Created a Dynamic Webservice in Eclipse
  Eclipse (Keplar IDE)
  SOAP webservice called GeoIPService which I found here: 
  http://www.webservicex.net/ws/WSDetails.aspx?WSID=64
  
  (More details can be found in the files committed)

Summary:
 This application is used to return the country location of and IP address.

How to use:
 Simply click the following link: [a link](http://caadress.appspot.com/)
 Next enter an IP address
 Then click the Submit button
 Finally the location of the IP address should be displayed on the next page

Notes:
 There are some instances in which some IP addresses can not be processed because
 of invalid IP addresses entered(a made up IP address)

 Another thing is that some IP locations are reserved because it may be protected by
 an ISP for security purposes

Below are some sample IP address that can be tested:
 Not working: 177.202.116.253
 Reserved: 235.109.43.172

 Taiwan: 140.128.30.207
